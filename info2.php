    <p class="lead my-3">- When you move through the water, through the curves you create small waves in the shape of an arc with your head and body, just like a boat or boat. The shape of the wave that you made by moving means that the water level on both sides of your body will decrease in relation to the pool, so that the air is now in that place. Breathe in the air at that place and you will not need to lift your head for a new breath - it's a good breathing technique. Sometimes swimmers call it breathing inside the air pocket because they feel that the air pocket is near their heads while swimming. To breathe in your air pocket, all you have to do is slowly rotate your head without extra lifting.</p>

    <p class="lead my-3"> -Do not rotate your head too far
    - A similar problem of lifting the head is excessive rotation of the head to the side, so you look up instead of the side when you breathe in the air. This is a bad technique that causes your body to rotate too much to one side and cause a lack of balance. In order to stay in balance you need to strive to settle with your leading hand, and you have to get used to breathe in your air pocket in such a way that your lower part of the head is underneath the water, so that one eye is above and the other eye is below the surface of the water.</p>

    <p class="lead my-3"> -The lack of rotation of the body can make it difficult to breathe properly
    - Good rotation of the body is a great help in breathing in the water. This is because with proper rotation of your body you will not have to turn your head very hard to breathe. If you're bothered with breathing just one side, you may not have a good rotation on that side. This usually happens when you start with bilateral swimming (meaning breathing on both sides of the body) - that side you do not inhale to date will pose a problem to you. However, do not give up. Every new skill requires time and adaptation period, and most importantly - it requires a change.</p>

    <p class="lead my-3">-Tips on how to overcome mental pressure
    At the beginning, it is very important to learn how to relax before the competition itself. Unfortunately, very few swimmers understand this assertion and really understand it, and as a result it puts enormous pressure on themselves before it comes to the very place of the competition:
    "I have to take one of the first three places";
    "I can not disappoint my parents and trainers who are watching me";
    "I have to come to the finals";
    "What if I lose again" ?;
    "This is my last chance to qualify."
    If you used to have some similar thoughts before the competitive part of the swim and think that it will provide you with some extra energy to run you, you are deceived because in such a situation something really is the opposite - your curtains will be shorter, your body tightened And without rhythm, the heartbeats will be accelerated, creating enormous pressure, and you will eventually swim much slower than you can in fact.You need to know that the bigger and more important the competition, you should stay more relaxed and relaxed, which does not mean that you can not be excited by your performance. "Butterflies" in the stomach are a completely normal thing, but you certainly do not want a butterfly that will hinder your thinking and concentration at the very crash.</p>
